# palindrode-kata

Palindrode TDD kata. Excercise based on the tutorial [Test-Driven Node.js Development With Grunt](http://markdalgleish.com/2012/09/test-driven-node-js-development-with-grunt/) from by Mark Dalgleish.

The project was implemented using the node [project scaffolding template for GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding), which includes test setup with [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit).
